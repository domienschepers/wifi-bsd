# Wi-Fi in BSD Systems

This repository provides an introduction to using and debugging Wi-Fi in BSD-based operating systems.

We hope to stimulate and encourage more research into the security and privacy of Wi-Fi.

## FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD

See [FreeBSD](freebsd) (Version 13.0), [OpenBSD](openbsd) (Version 6.8, 6.9), and [NetBSD](netbsd) (Version 9.2).

For each operating system we describe typical topics such as:
- Configuring network interfaces,
- Starting an access point and client,
- Rebuilding the kernel with debug statements,
- Rebuilding kernel modules or drivers with debug statements, and
- Logging tips and tricks to increase verbosity.

## Wi-Fi Hardware

We evaluated support for a variety of hardware in FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.

For more information, see [Wi-Fi Hardware](HARDWARE.md).
